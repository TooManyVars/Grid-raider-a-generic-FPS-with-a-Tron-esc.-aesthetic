# Grid-raider-a-generic-FPS-with-a-Tron-esc.-aesthetic
The name is pretty self explanatory(but for the sake of being elaborate, I've added more info in the readme file). 

i've gotten the game to a point where it is now playable, but i intend to create more content and optimisations for it. 
The file formatting is a little bad, i know, but keep in mind that when i tell unreal to delete something, it only really complies like 50% of the time,
which is quite annoying.
